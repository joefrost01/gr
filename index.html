<P><H1>This is the website for the GR Panda Campaign</H1>

<p>Our aim is to get people to think differently about the things that are part of office life.</p>

<ul>
    <li>How can we build the work environment that we want to be part of?</li>
    <li>How can we make our work more meaningful?</li>
    <li>How can we reduce our footprint on the planet?</li>
    <li>How can we use our time in better ways?</li>
    <li>How can we collaborate more effectively?</li>
    <li>How can we use language in more effective ways?</li>
    <li>How can technology help us do these things?</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Why did we choose the panda as our symbol? Well who doesn't love pandas! We like the stencil art style of diagram, they simple, impactful and people seem to get excited when they pop up spontaneously. Pandas are pretty much black and white, so they look great in stencils, they have thoughtful and expressive faces. We intentionally wanted to stay away from the kind of pictures that you normally find in offices so that our content is more noticeable. The panda has traditionally been associated with conservation, climate and protection of wildlife, all things that are dear to our hearts.
